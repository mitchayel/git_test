Tips
- Always name the HTML file that will contain the homepage of our website "index.html"
    - This is because web servers will by default look for an index.html page when users land on our websites. Not having one will create problems!
- HTML files have to include an <html> element at the beginning of a document. Known as the root. 
- <head> is where we put important meta-information about our webpages, and stuff required for our webpages to render correctly in the browser.
    - Inside <head> we don't use any element that displays content on the webpage.
    - <title> should always be included in the <head>
        - This will be the listed title in the browser tab
- *Last boilerplate step* is to include <body>.
    - the <body> exists within the <html> element but comes after <head>

Odin boilerplate example below:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
  </head>

  <body>
  </body>
</html>

Shortcuts!!!!
- Typing ! at the beginning of an html file will automatically add all the boilerplate code
- [Ctrl + /] automatically comments out a given line
- Typing [lorem] will generate dummy text in vscode
